TypeScript Deep Dive
=======

I've been looking at the issues that turn up commonly when people start using TypeScript. This is based on the lessons from [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/typescript/topusers) / [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/) and general engagement with the [TypeScript community](https://github.com/TypeStrong/). You can [follow for updates](https://twitter.com/basarat).

If you are here to read the book [get started](http://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/docs/getting-started.html).

You can also do one of the following:
* [EPUB for iPad,iPhone,Mac](https://www.gitbook.com/download/epub/book/basarat/typescript)
