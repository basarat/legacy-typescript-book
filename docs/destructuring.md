### Destructuring

TypeScript supports the following forms of Destructuring (literally named after de-stucturing i.e. breaking up the structure):

1. Object Destructuring
1. Array Destructuring

#### Object Destructuring
Destructuring  is useful because it allows you to do in a single line, what would otherwise require multiple lines. Consider the following case:

```ts
var rect = { x: 0, y: 10, width: 15, height: 20 };

// Destructuring assignment
var {x, y, width, height} = rect;
console.log(x, y, width, height); // 0,10,15,20
```
Here in the absence of destructuring you would have to pick off `x,y,width,height` one by one from `rect`.

#### Array Destructuring
A common programming question : Swap two variables without using a third one. The TypeScript solution:

```ts
var x = 1, y = 2;
[x, y] = [y, x];
console.log(x, y); // 2,1
```
Note that array destructuring is effectively the compiler doing the `[0], [1], ...` and so on for you. There is no guarantee that these values will exist.

#### Array Destructuring with rest
You can pick up any number of elements from the array and get *an array* of the remaining elements using array destructuring with rest.

```ts
var [x, y, ...remaining] = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(x, y, remaining); // 1, 2, [3,4]
```

#### Array Destructuring with ignores
You can ignore any index by simply leaving its location empty i.e. `, ,` in the left hand side of the assignment. For example:
```ts
var [x, , ...remaining] = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(x, remaining); // 1, [3,4]
```

#### JS Generation
The JavaScript generation for non ES6 targets simply involves creating temporary variables, just like you would have to do yourself without native language support for destructuring e.g.

```ts
var x = 1, y = 2;
[x, y] = [y, x];
console.log(x, y); // 2,1

// becomes //

var x = 1, y = 2;
_a = [y,x], x = _a[0], y = _a[1];
console.log(x, y);
var _a;
```

#### Summary
Destructuring can make your code more readable and maintainable by reducing the line count and making the intent clear. Array destructuring can allow you to use arrays as though they were tuples.
